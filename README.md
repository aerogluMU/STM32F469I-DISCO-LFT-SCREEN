# STM32F469I-DISCO-LFT-SCREEN

## Content of Project

The subject of this project is to develop a software that controls led states using various functions and provides communication using various communication protocols. In addition, it is to make a design that will show these situations on the TFT screen.

- The functions to be used to change the states of the LEDs are respectively: **Timers**

- The communication protocols used are respectively: **USART**, **Can BUS**
	> USART and Can BUS communication protocols are bilateral.

## The Board Used in The Project

This project used **STM32F469I-DISCO** board.
